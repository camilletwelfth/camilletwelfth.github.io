			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text" lang="en-GB">Musicians attending</h2>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Duke</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">If music be the food of love, play on,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">The appetite may sicken and so die</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">That strain again! It had a dying fall;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">O, it came o’er my ear like the sweet sound</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">That breathes upon a bank of violets,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Stealing and giving odour! Enough, no more;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">‘Tis not so sweet now as it was before</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">O spirit of love, how quick and fresh art thou!</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">That, notwithstanding thy capacity</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Of what validity and pitch soe’er,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">But falls into abatement and low price</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Even in a minute. So full of shapes is fancy,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">That it alone is high fantastical</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Curio</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Will you go hunt, my lord?</p>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Duke</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Why, so I do, the noblest that I have</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Methought she purg’d the air of pestilence!</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">That instant was I turn’d into a hart,</p>

			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">So please my lord, I might not be admitted,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">But from her handmaid do return this answer:</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">The element itself, till seven years’ heat,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Shall not behold her face at ample view;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">But like a cloistress she will veiled walk,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And water once a day her chamber round</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">With eye-offending brine; all this to season</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">A brother’s dead love, which she would keep fresh</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And lasting in her sad remembrance</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Duke</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">To pay this debt of love but to a brother,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">How will she love when the rich golden shaft</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Hath kill’d the flock of all affections else</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">That live in her; when liver, brain, and heart,</p>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Viola</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">What country, friends, is this?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Captain</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">This is Illyria, lady</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Viola</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And what should I do in Illyria?</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">My brother he is in Elysium</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Perchance he is not drown’d- what think you, sailors?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Captain</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">It is perchance that you yourself were saved</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Viola</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Captain</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">True, madam, and, to comfort you with chance,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Assure yourself, after our ship did split,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">When you, and those poor number saved with you,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Most provident in peril, bind himself-</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Courage and hope both teaching him the practice-</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">To a strong mast that liv’d upon the sea;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Where, like Arion on the dolphin’s back,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">So long as I could see</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Viola</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">For saying so, there’s gold</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Whereto thy speech serves for authority,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">The like of him. Know’st thou this country?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Captain</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Not three hours’ travel from this very place</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Viola</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Who governs here?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Captain</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">A noble duke, in nature as in name</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Viola</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">What is his name?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Captain</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Orsino</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Viola</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Orsino! I have heard my father name him</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">He was a bachelor then</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Captain</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And so is now, or was so very late;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">For but a month ago I went from hence,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And then ‘twas fresh in murmur- as, you know,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">What great ones do the less will prattle of-</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">That he did seek the love of fair Olivia</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Viola</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">What’s she?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Captain</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">In the protection of his son, her brother,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Who shortly also died; for whose dear love,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">They say, she hath abjur’d the company</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And sight of men</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Viola</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">O that I serv’d that lady,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And might not be delivered to the world,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">What my estate is!</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Captain</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">That were hard to compass,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Because she will admit no kind of suit-</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">No, not the Duke’s</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Viola</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">There is a fair behaviour in thee, Captain;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And though that nature with a beauteous wall</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I will believe thou hast a mind that suits</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">With this thy fair and outward character</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I prithee, and I’ll pay thee bounteously,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Conceal me what I am, and be my aid</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">For such disguise as haply shall become</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">The form of my intent. I’ll serve this duke:</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Thou shalt present me as an eunuch to him;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">It may be worth thy pains, for I can sing</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And speak to him in many sorts of music,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">That will allow me very worth his service</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">What else may hap to time I will commit;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Only shape thou silence to my wit</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Captain</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Be you his eunuch and your mute I’ll be;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Viola</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I thank thee. Lead me on</p>

			<h2 class="location" lang="en-GB">Olivia’s house</h2>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text" lang="en-GB">Enter Sir Toby Belch and Maria</h2>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Sir Toby</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">What a plague means my niece to take the death of her brother thus? I am sure care’s an enemy to life</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Maria</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o’ nights; your cousin, my lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Sir Toby</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Why, let her except before excepted</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Maria</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of order</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Sir Toby</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Confine! I’ll confine myself no finer than I am. These clothes are good enough to drink in, and so be these boots too; an they be not, let them hang themselves in their own straps</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Maria</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">That quaffing and drinking will undo you; I heard my lady talk of it yesterday, and of a foolish knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Sir Toby</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Who? Sir Andrew Aguecheek?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Maria</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Ay, he</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Sir Toby</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">He’s as tall a man as any’s in Illyria</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Maria</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">What’s that to th’ purpose?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Sir Toby</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Why, he has three thousand ducats a year</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Maria</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Ay, but he’ll have but a year in all these ducats; he’s a very fool and a prodigal</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Sir Toby</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Fie that you’ll say so! He plays o’ th’ viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages word for word without book, and hath all the good gifts of nature</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Maria</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">He hath indeed, almost natural; for, besides that he’s a fool, he’s a great quarreller; and but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath in quarrelling, ‘tis thought among the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a grave</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Sir Toby</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">By this hand, they are scoundrels and subtractors that say so of him. Who are they?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Maria</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">They that add, moreover, he’s drunk nightly in your company</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Sir Toby</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">With drinking healths to my niece; I’ll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat and drink in Illyria.He’s a coward and a coystrill that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o’ th’ toe like a parish-top. What, wench! Castiliano vulgo! for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface</p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text" lang="en-GB">Enter Sir Andrew Aguecheek</h2>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Aguecheek</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Sir Toby Belch! How now, Sir Toby Belch!</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Sir Toby</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Sweet Sir Andrew!</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Aguecheek</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Bless you, fair shrew</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Maria</p>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Aguecheek</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">What’s that?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Sir Toby</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">My niece’s chambermaid</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Aguecheek</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Maria</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">My name is Mary, sir</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Aguecheek</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Good Mistress Mary Accost-</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Sir Toby. </p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">You mistake, knight. ‘Accost’ is front her, board her, woo her, assail her</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Aguecheek</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Is that the meaning of ‘accost’?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Maria</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Fare you well, gentlemen</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Sir Toby</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never draw sword again!</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Aguecheek</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">An you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have fools in hand?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Maria</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Sir, I have not you by th’ hand</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Aguecheek</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Marry, but you shall have; and here’s my hand</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Maria</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Now, sir, thought is free. I pray you, bring your hand to th’ buttry-bar and let it drink</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Aguecheek</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Wherefore, sweetheart? What’s your metaphor?</p>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Aguecheek</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Never in your life, I think; unless you see canary put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has; but I am great eater of beef, and I believe that does harm to my wit</p>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Aguecheek</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Faith, I’ll home to-morrow, Sir Toby. Your niece will not be seen, or if she be, it’s four to one she’ll none of me; the Count himself here hard by woos her</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Sir Toby</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">She’ll none o’ th’ Count; she’ll not match above her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; I have heard her swear’t. Tut, there’s life in’t, man</p>

Why dost thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in a coranto? My very walk should be a jig; I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in? I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy leg, it was form’d under the star of a galliard</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Aguecheek</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Ay, ‘tis strong, and it does indifferent well in flame-colour’d stock. Shall we set about some revels?</p>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Aguecheek</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Taurus? That’s sides and heart</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Sir Toby</p>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Clown</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Wit, an’t be thy will, put me into good fooling! Those wits that think they have thee do very oft prove fools; and I that am sure I lack thee may pass for a wise man. For what says Quinapalus? ‘Better a witty fool than a foolish wit.’ God bless thee, lady!</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Olivia</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Take the fool away</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Clown</p>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Olivia</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Go to, y’are a dry fool; I’ll no more of you. Besides, you grow dishonest</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Clown</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel will amend; for give the dry fool drink, then is the fool not dry. Bid the dishonest man mend himself: if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Anything that’s mended is but patch’d; virtue that transgresses is but patch’d with sin, and sin that amends is but patch’d with virtue.If that this simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not, what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but calamity, so beauty’s a flower. The lady bade take away the fool; therefore, I say again, take her away</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Olivia</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Sir, I bade them take away you</p>

			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Can you do it?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Clown</p>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Clown</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I must catechize you for it, madonna</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Good my mouse of virtue, answer me</p>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Clown</p>

			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the better fool</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Clown</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no fox; but he will not pass his word for twopence that you are no fool</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Olivia</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">How say you to that, Malvolio?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Malvolio</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal; I saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that has no more brain than a stone. Look you now, he’s out of his guard already; unless you laugh and minister occasion to him, he is gagg’d. I protest I take these wise men that crow so at these set kind of fools no better than the fools’ zanies</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Olivia</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">O, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste with a distemper’d appetite. To be generous, guiltless, and of free disposition, is to take those things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon bullets. There is no slander in an allow’d fool, though he do nothing but rail; nor no railing in known discreet man, though he do nothing but reprove</p>

I would be loath to cast away my speech; for, besides that it is excellently well penn’d, I have taken great pains to con it. Good beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very comptible, even to the least sinister usage</p>

He left behind him myself and a sister, both born in an hour; if the heavens had been pleas’d, would we had so ended!

Be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; let thy tongue tang arguments of state; put thyself into the trick of singularity. She thus advises thee that sighs for thee. Remember who commended thy yellow stockings, and wish’d to see thee ever cross-garter’d. I say, remember, Go to, thou art made, if thou desir’st to be so; if not, let me see thee a steward still, the fellow of servants, and not worthy to touch Fortune’s fingers. Farewell.

I do not now fool myself to let imagination jade me; for every reason excites to this, that my lady loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of late, she did praise my leg being cross-garter’d; and in this she manifests herself to my love, and with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits of her liking. I thank my stars I am happy. I will be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and cross-garter’d, even with the swiftness of putting on. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet a postscript</p>

			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I would, therefore, my sister had had name, sir</p>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Clown</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Why, sir, her name’s a word; and to dally with that word might make my sister wanton. But indeed words are very rascals since bonds disgrac’d them</p>

			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly; she will keep no fool, sir, till she be married; and fools are as like husbands as pilchers are to herrings- the husband’s the bigger. I am indeed not her fool, but her corrupter of words</p>

			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">And they have been grand-jurymen since before Noah was a sailor</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Fabian</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">She did show favour to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour, to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver. You should then have accosted her; and with some excellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should have bang’d the youth into dumbness. This was look’d for at your hand, and this was baulk’d. The double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off, and you are now sail’d into the north of my lady’s opinion; where you will hang like an icicle on Dutchman’s beard, unless you do redeem it by some laudable attempt either of valour or policy</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Aguecheek</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">An’t be any way, it must be with valour, for policy I hate; I had as lief be a Brownist as a politician</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Sir Toby</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valour. Challenge me the Count’s youth to fight with him; hurt him in eleven places. My niece shall take note of it; and assure thyself there is no love-broker in the world can more prevail in man’s commendation with woman than report of valour</p>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Sir Toby</p>

			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Taunt him with the license of ink; if thou thou’st him some thrice, it shall not be amiss; and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of paper, although the sheet were big enough for the bed of Ware in England, set ‘em down; go about it. Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou write with a goose-pen, no matter. About it</p>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Sir Toby</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Never trust me then; and by all means stir on the youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were open’d and you find so much blood in his liver as will clog the foot of a flea, I’ll eat the rest of th’ anatomy</p>

Yond gull Malvolio is turned heathen, a very renegado; for there is no Christian that means to be saved by believing rightly can ever believe such impossible passages of grossness. He’s in yellow stockings</p>

He does obey every point of the letter that I dropp’d to betray him. He does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies. You have not seen such a thing as ‘tis; Ican hardly forbear hurling things at him. I know my lady will strike him; if she do, he’ll smile and take’t for a great favour</p>

			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">What we took from them; which, for traffic’s sake,</p>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Servant</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Madam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino’s is return’d; I could hardly entreat him back; he attends your ladyship’s pleasure</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Olivia</p>

			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text" lang="en-GB">[Exit Servant] </h2>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Good Maria, let this fellow be look’d to. Where’s my cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a special care of him; I would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry</p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text" lang="en-GB">Exeunt Olivia and Maria</h2>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Malvolio</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">O, ho! do you come near me now? No worse man than Sir Toby to look to me! This concurs directly with the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may appear stubborn to him; for she incites me to that in the letter. ‘Cast thy humble slough,’ says she. ‘Be opposite with kinsman, surly with servants; let thy tongue tang with arguments of state; put thyself into the trick of singularity’ and consequently sets down the manner how, as: a sad face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have lim’d her; but it is Jove’s doing, and Jove make me thankful! And when she went away now- ‘Let this fellow be look’d to.’ ‘Fellow,’ not ‘Malvolio’ nor after my degree, but ‘fellow.’ Why, everything adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous or unsafe circumstance- What can be said? Nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the doer of this, and he is to be thanked</p>

We may carry it thus, for our pleasure and his penance, till our very pastime, tired out of breath, prompt us to have mercy on him; at which time we will bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a finder of madmen.

			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Now will not I deliver his letter; for the behaviour of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good capacity and breeding; his employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less. Therefore this letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no terror in the youth: he will find it comes from a clodpole. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth, set upon Aguecheek notable report of valour, and drive the gentleman- as know his youth will aptly receive it- into a most hideous opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and impetuosity. This will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look, like cockatrices</p>

			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">That defence thou hast, betake thee tot. Of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know not; but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as the hunter, attends thee at the orchard end. Dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for thy assailant is quick, skilful, and deadly</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Viola</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">You mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me; my remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offence done to any man</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Sir Toby</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">You’ll find it otherwise, I assure you; therefore, if you hold your life at any price, betake you to your guard; for your opposite hath in him what youth, strength, skill, and wrath, can furnish man withal</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Viola</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I pray you, sir, what is he?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Sir Toby</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">He is knight, dubb’d with unhatch’d rapier and on carpet consideration; but he is a devil in private brawl. Souls and bodies hath he divorc’d three; and his incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre. Hob-nob is his word- give’t or take’t</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Viola</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">I will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others to taste their valour; belike this is a man of that quirk</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Sir Toby</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Sir, no; his indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury; therefore, get you on and give him his desire. Back you shall not to the house, unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him; therefore on, or strip your sword stark naked; for meddle you must, that’s certain, or forswear to wear iron about you</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Viola</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you do me this courteous office as to know of the knight what my offence to him is: it is something of my negligence, nothing of my purpose</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Sir Toby</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">I Will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this gentleman till my return</p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text" lang="en-GB">Exit Sir Toby</h2>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Viola</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Fabian</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">I know the knight is incens’d against you, even to a mortal arbitrement; but nothing of the circumstance more</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Viola</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I beseech you, what manner of man is he?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Fabian</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by his form, as you are like to find him in the proof of his valour. He is indeed, sir, the most skilful, bloody, and fatal opposite that you could possibly have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk towards him? I will make your peace with him if I can</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Viola</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">I shall be much bound to you for’t. I am one that would rather go with sir priest than sir knight. I care not who knows so much of my mettle. </p>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Sir Toby</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Why, man, he’s a very devil; I have not seen such a firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard, and all, and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal motion that it is inevitable; and on the answer, he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they step on. They say he has been fencer to the Sophy</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Aguecheek</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Pox on’t, I’ll not meddle with him</p>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Aguecheek</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Plague on’t; an I thought he had been valiant, and so cunning in fence, I’d have seen him damn’d ere I’d have challeng’d him. Let him let the matter slip, and I’ll give him my horse, grey Capilet</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Sir Toby</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">I’ll make the motion. Stand here, make a good show on’t; this shall end without the perdition of souls. <span class="inlinestagedirections">[Aside]</span> Marry, I’ll ride your horse as well as I ride you</p>

			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Viola</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB"><span class="inlinestagedirections">[Aside]</span>Pray God defend me! A little thing would make me tell them how much I lack of a man</p>

			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text" lang="en-GB">Re-enter Fabian, with Malvolio</h2>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Duke</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Is this the madman?</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Olivia</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Ay, my lord, this same</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">How now, Malvolio!</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Malvolio</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Madam, you have done me wrong,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Notorious wrong</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Olivia</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Have I, Malvolio? No</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Malvolio</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Lady, you have. Pray you peruse that letter</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">You must not now deny it is your hand;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Write from it if you can, in hand or phrase;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Or say ‘tis not your seal, not your invention;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">You can say none of this. Well, grant it then,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And tell me, in the modesty of honour,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Bade me come smiling and cross-garter’d to you,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">To put on yellow stockings, and to frown</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And, acting this in an obedient hope,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Why have you suffer’d me to be imprison’d,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And made the most notorious geck and gul</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">That e’er invention play’d on? Tell me why</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Olivia</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Though, I confess, much like the character;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">But out of question ‘tis Maria’s hand</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And now I do bethink me, it was she</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">First told me thou wast mad; then cam’st in smiling,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And in such forms which here were presuppos’d</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">This practice hath most shrewdly pass’d upon thee,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">But, when we know the grounds and authors of it,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Of thine own cause</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Fabian</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Good madam, hear me speak,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Taint the condition of this present hour,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Which I have wond’red at. In hope it shall not,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Most freely I confess myself and Toby</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Set this device against Malvolio here,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">We had conceiv’d against him. Maria writ</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">The letter, at Sir Toby’s great importance,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">In recompense whereof he hath married her</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">How with a sportful malice it was follow’d</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">May rather pluck on laughter than revenge,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">If that the injuries be justly weigh’d</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">That have on both sides pass’d</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Olivia</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Alas, poor fool, how have they baffl’d thee!</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Clown</p>
			<p class="prose" lang="en-GB">Why, ‘Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrown upon them.’ I was one, sir, in this interlude- one Sir Topas, sir; but that’s all one. ‘By the Lord, fool, I am not mad!’ But do you remember- ‘Madam, why laugh you at such a barren rascal? An you smile not, he’s gagg’d’? And thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Malvolio</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">I’ll be reveng’d on the whole pack of you</p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text" lang="en-GB">Exit</h2>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Olivia</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">He hath been most notoriously abus’d</p>
			<p class="character" lang="en-GB">Duke</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Pursue him, and entreat him to a peace;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">He hath not told us of the captain yet</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">When that is known, and golden time convents,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">A solemn combination shall be made</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Of our dear souls. Meantime, sweet sister,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">We will not part from hence. Cesario, come;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">For so you shall be while you are a man;</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">But when in other habits you are seen,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Orsino’s mistress, and his fancy’s queen</p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text" lang="en-GB">Exeunt all but the Clown</h2>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">Clown sings</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">When that I was and a little tiny boy,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">A foolish thing was but a toy,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">For the rain it raineth every day</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">But when I came to man’s estate,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,</p>

			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">For the rain it raineth every day</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">But when I came, alas! to wive,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">By swaggering could I never thrive,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">For the rain it raineth every day</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">But when I came unto my beds,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">With toss-pots still had drunken heads,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">For the rain it raineth every day</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">A great while ago the world begun,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,</p>
			<p class="verseline" lang="en-GB">But that’s all one, our play is done,</p>
