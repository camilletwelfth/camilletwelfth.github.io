        <li>The moons circling around the planet of Uranus are mostly named after characters from Shakespeare plays, including Oberon, Ariel, and Juliet. </li>
        <li>
        Shakespeare had a poem sketched into his tomb in Trinity Church, Stratford-upon-Avon. It says anyone who moves his bones will be cursed. Consequently, his grave has gone untouched since 1747.</li>
        <li>
        Shakespeare never published any of his own plays. Thankfully his friends John Heminges and Henry Condell did it posthumously and saved the world of theatre. </li>
